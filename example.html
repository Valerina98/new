<h2 class="special_text">How to Brew Coffee</h2>

<p>Great coffee starts with great beans. The quality and flavor of your coffee is not only determined by your favorite brewing process, but also by the type of coffee you select. So don't be an idiot and please select quality beans. You don't want your coffee tasting like crap, now, do you? </p>

<h2>Coffee Bars in NYC</h2>

<p>Stumptown: If you prefer your coffee-ordering process to better resemble that of ordering a high-end cocktail, Stumptown is the place for you. Drip and espresso are but two of the brewing possibilities at the coffee bar’s two New York locations; there’s also French Press, AeroPress, Vacuum Pot, Kalita Wave, Hario V60, Filtron, Chemex, and Bee House. Confused? Us, too. But don’t fret: the concierge-style baristas will guide you through your coffee “experience,” elevating you to a new level of coffee snobbery in the process and leaving you with a solid caffeine buzz.
